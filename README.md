# Webtorrent-beacon
Create new torrent and receive a beacon when a new peer requests it

##
Webtorrent-beacon instantly sends a beacon when a new peer requests your torrent. It does't care whether or not the new peer has actually connected to the torrent.

let beacon = new Beacon(opts, filename, data, beacon => {
 console.log('Torrent has a new peer:', beacon) // true
})

beacon.infoHash(infoHash => {
 console.log(infoHash)
})

beacon.magnet(magnet => {
 console.log(magnet)
})

```
